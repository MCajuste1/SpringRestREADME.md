REST { REpresentational State Transfer } is an architectural style for designing distributed network applications

Six principles of REST

- Client-Server // seperation between client and server and this allows both components evolve independently and in return grants the system to a scale.
- Stateless // server shouldn't remember the state of the client but clients MUST include all of the information in the request so the server can understand it and proceed.
- Layered System // contains many layers such as gateways, firewalls, and proxies can exist between client and server.. ALso layers can be added, modified, and more to improve flexiblity.
- Cache // responses from the server
